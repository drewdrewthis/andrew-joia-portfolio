			<h1>Introduction &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;</h1>
			<p>I&#39;m a Front End Web Developer working as a freelancer in Brooklyn, NY. I've been working on small clent websites and design jobs here and there for the past 8 years or so, but have decided to really up my game, get the strong technical base that
			I feel I&#39;ve been lacking, and acquire the skills I need to expand out into a Full Stack developer.</p>
			<p>I&#39;m good at working independently, but am excited to be working with someone who is better than me and that can give me guidance and new perspectives. <strong>My ultimate goal is to develop my career in web design/development - I&#39;m hoping that becoming a Thinkful student is the perfect way to do so.</strong></p>

			<h1>Where I'm from &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;</h1>
			<p>I'm originally from NY - I grew up on Long Island. It was the standard Northeast costal suburb, and I was excited to leave. During and after college, I travelled extensively, and now, though I'm from Long Island, I really feel that I'm from a nomadic
			origin, full of the cultures and experiences of an unboxed life.</p>

			<h1>More About Me &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;</h1>
			<h2>What are my favorite hobbies?</h2>
			<p>I'm a passionate traveler, musician, artist, and computer geek. I'm also an avid SCUBA diver.</p>
			<h2>What&#39;s your dream job?</h2>
			<p>My dream job is an engaging web-based engineering job with a interesting and impactful company. It would be a job that challenges me intellectually, pushes me to advance my skills, and that allows me to live a full and diversified life.</p>
			<h2>What&#39;s your background?</h2>
			<p>I&#39;ve always been an artist and loved technology. I first study programming in middle school with PASCAL &#40;crazy, right!?&#41;, and started to do web design on the side while living in China. It started off as a hobby to compliment my photography,
			and I&#39;ve stuck with it on a small scale for years. It&#39;s now time to buckle down and take it to the next level!</p>
